1.	What have you done personally in the two weeks leading up to today?
-  Started a power-point presentation that will give a summary of the open source cloud project that will tie into a demonstration of the configured Web-Server.

2.  Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.
	- Demonstration will include virtual machine (VM) annotation to verify working aspects on the NextCloud app within different OS platform. We will attempt to get a full backup of configured servers a long with a descriptive write up for the client as requested.

3. Give a link to the journal file in your repository
